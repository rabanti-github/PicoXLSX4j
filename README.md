PicoXLSX4j is a small Java library to create XLSX files (Microsoft Excel 2007 or newer) in an easy and native way. It is a direct port of [PicoXLSX for C#](https://github.com/rabanti-github/PicoXLSX)

* No need for an installation of Microsoft Office
* No need for Office interop/DCOM or other bridging libraries
* No need for 3rd party libraries
* Pure usage of standard JRE

**Please have a look at the successor library [NanoXLSX4j](https://github.com/rabanti-github/NanoXLSX4j) for reader support.**

# Requirements
PicoXLSX4j was created with Java 8 and is fully compatible with Java 7<br>
The only requirement for developments are a current JDK to develop and JRE to run.

# Installation
## As JAR
Simply place the PicoXLSX4j jar file (e.g. **picoxlsx4j-2.5.5.jar**) into the lib folder of your project and create a library reference to it in your IDE.
## As source files
Place all .java files from the PicoXLSX4j source folder into your project. The folder structure defines the packages. Please use refactoring if you want to relocate the files.
## Maven ##

# Usage
## Quick Start (shortened syntax)
```java
 Workbook workbook = new Workbook("myWorkbook.xlsx", "Sheet1");         // Create new workbook with a worksheet called Sheet1
 workbook.WS.value("Some Data");                                        // Add cell A1
 workbook.WS.formula("=A1");                                            // Add formula to cell B1
 workbook.WS.down();                                                    // Go to row 2
 workbook.WS.value(new Date(), BasicStyles.Bold());                     // Add formatted value to cell A2
 try{
   workbook.save();                                                     // Save the workbook as myWorkbook.xlsx
 } catch (Exception ex) {}
```

## Quick Start (regular syntax)
```java
 Workbook workbook = new Workbook("myWorkbook.xlsx", "Sheet1");       // Create new workbook with a worksheet called Sheet1
 workbook.getCurrentWorksheet().addNextCell("Some Data");             // Add cell A1
 workbook.getCurrentWorksheet().addNextCell(42);                      // Add cell B1
 workbook.getCurrentWorksheet().goToNextRow();                        // Go to row 2
 workbook.getCurrentWorksheet().addNextCell(new Date());              // Add cell A2
 try {
   workbook.Save();                                                   // Save the workbook as myWorkbook.xlsx
 } catch (Exception ex) {}
```
